Book Locator

Final project of the Code in Place course using the Python language, based on material from the Stanford University's. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Think of an idea As I have a lot of books and I waste a lot of time looking for where they are, I thought of creating a program that would allow me to insert books with the location of the bookcase and shelf and provide a search either by title or by author in order to know where the book is stored. Step 2: Reflect I'd use dictionaries and save data into a text file.

App asks if the user wants to insert, to see the list of books, search by title, search by author or exit the program.

If app finds the book, shows all the book's data: Title, Author, Year, ISBN, bookcase location and shelf location.

Step 3: Plan Milestones Define the structure of your program Enhance your program Test the program Use VS Code and GitHub.

Step 4: Add new features: handling for duplicate titles; delete a book by index
