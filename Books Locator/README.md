Book Locator
GOAL DEADLINE:  

Your final project is a chance to make any interesting application you would like. Design a final project that you can complete in two weeks. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Think of an idea
As I have a lot of books and I waste a lot of time looking for where they are, I thought of creating a program that would allow me to insert books with the location of the cabinet and shelf and provide a search either by title or by author in order to know where the book is stored.
Step 2: Reflect
Fantastic! That sounds like a well scoped project. We have some questions to help you think about your project idea. Take some time to think about them and write your answers below.

Feel free to write as much or as little as you want, or to say if you're not sure about anything. The more accurate your answers are, the better we can help you come up with a plan.

Great idea! To get us started, can you tell me more about how you'd like the user experience to be? For example, how would a user add a new book and its location to your program?

I thought I'd use dictionaries.
Using dictionaries sounds like a good approach! How do you envision the user searching for a book? Would they type the title or author into a search box, or do you have something else in mind?

I thought I'd ask if I wanted to insert or search, and if I answered that I wanted to search, allow me to choose whether it's by author or title.
That sounds like a solid plan! When the user wants to search for a book, how would you like to display the search results? For example, would you show the book's location on the screen or use some other method?

If I find it, I'll show you all the information about the book.
Awesome! What kind of information do you want to store for each book besides its title, author, and location?

Title, author, publisher, location composed of cupboard and shelf.
Anything else we should know when building milestones?

Step 3: Plan Milestones
There are many ways to approach your project, but here's one. If you need some help getting started, here's a guide to help you through the process. You can mark each step as completed as you go.

Of course, feel free to take your own path. It's the journey that matters, not the destination.

Define the structure of your program
Start by deciding the overall structure of your program. You’ll need functions for adding books, searching books by title, and searching books by author. You may also want a main function to handle user interactions like choosing to add or search for a book.

Set up your data structure
You'll use dictionaries to store the book information. Create a dictionary where the key is the title or author, and the value is another dictionary with all the details about the book.

Create the add book functionality
Write a function that prompts the user to input details about a book and stores those details in the dictionary. Ensure you handle adding the book's title, author, publisher, and location accurately.

Worked Example: Add Two Numbers
Create the search functionality
Write functions that allow the user to search for a book by title or author. These functions should prompt the user for the relevant information and then search through the dictionary to find and display the book's details.

Here are some resources that might help you with this step:
Lesson: Lists
Worked Example: Count Nums
Create the main menu
Develop a main function that serves as a menu system, where users can choose to either add a new book or search for an existing one. This function will call the appropriate helper functions based on the user's choice.

Test your program
Run your program and test all functionalities (adding books, searching by title, and searching by author). Make sure the information is stored correctly and the searches return the appropriate details.

Enhance your program
If you have extra time, consider adding features like error handling for duplicate titles/authors, a way to update book information, or a graphical user interface for a better user experience.

Worked Example: Programming is Awesome
Get Started!
Now that you have a plan for your project, it's time to jump right in:

Use the Code in Place IDE
Download and learn to use VS Code
Please ask for help on the Forum if you have trouble (1) deciding on a good project, (2) getting started, (3) conceptual challenges. We are all one big team and we want to support one another.



Submission
We’ll be publishing the project showcase around , so we’d recommend submitting your project by the goal deadline. If you want to make changes or submit later, you’ll be able to do so until the end of June, and the showcase will be updated periodically.

You don't need to pre-specify a project as your "final project" until submission. Your final deliverable is the url of a published project, or a link to a github project.



Your final project is a chance to make any interesting application you would like.
